**Important things about Gen VI's Event Database**

Event Database links are hardcoded in the program, so it knows where to look for stuff. The point is that writing this stuff is very difficult to do alone, so lots of event descriptions are unavailable at the moment.

---

**Where gamesaves have to be?**

Saves are directly taken/saved from your cartridge/digital copy of the game (thanks @J-K-D). Just select the proper game in the application.

**The application will look first for a cartridge, then for a digital copy of the game!**

---

**What will come next?**

* More Powersaves-like features;
* Capture probability calculation support for I-II gens;
* Regular updates to the Event Database.

Tell me if you like this work and what you would have featured in the next update! :)
