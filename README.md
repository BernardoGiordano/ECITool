**[EventAssistant](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/EventAssistant/releases): what is this?**

[**EventAssistant**](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/EventAssistant/releases) is a general purpose Pokémon save editor and information viewer that can be run on your console (you need *Homebrew Launcher* to launch the *.3dsx* version or *CFW* to install the *.cia* version on the console and run it from the home menu, or Citra to run the *.3dsx* version on your PC).

This application allows you to make some cool things, like:

* Check **Gen VI's Event Database**;
* **Inject WC6s** into a XY or ORAS save file. Multiple injection is allowed;
* **Mass inject** old gen event distributions or collections!
* **Edit Pokémon stats**, like friendship, IVs, EVs, hidden Power, shinyness, nickname, pokerus and **clone** easily single pokémons or entire boxes;
* **Edit you save** like Powersaves does, directly from your 3DS. You can edit *money*, *Battle Points*, *items* and much more;
* Seeing **current event distributions** directly from your 3DS. It provides infos about start and end dates of local and wifi distributions, with related codes if there is a general code for the distribution;
* **Capture probability calculation**: you can now calculate it directly on your 3DS, for every generation starting by the third. You can also calculate how much tries are needed to reach a certain probability of success;
* Check **Powersaves dates** for common Hacked Events.

**Important things about Gen VI's Event Database**

Event Database links are hardcoded in the program, so it knows where to look for stuff. The point is that writing this stuff is very difficult to do alone, so lots of event descriptions are unavailable at the moment.

---

**Where gamesaves have to be?**

Saves are directly taken/saved from your cartridge/digital copy of the game (thanks @J-K-D). Just select the proper game in the application.

**The application will look first for a cartridge, then for a digital copy of the game!**

---

**What will come next?**

* More Powersaves-like features;
* Capture probability calculation support for I-II gens;
* Regular updates to the Event Database.

Tell me if you like this work and what you would have featured in the next update! :)
