# ECITool
A general purpose tool mostly oriented to event collectors.

**[ECI Tool](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/ECITool/releases): what is this?**

[**ECI Tool**](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/ECITool/releases) is a general purpose pokémon application that can be run on your 3DS (you need *Homebrew Launcher* to launch the *.3dsx* version or EmuNAND to run the *.cia* version.

This application allows you to make some cool things, like:

* Checking **PID** of a pokémon. Pretty useful to check very old events, that may be manipulated with old tools and could have leftovers of manipulation. You can see if calculations done by the app are coherent with the pokémon.
* Seeing **current event distributions** directly from your 3DS. It provides infos about start and end dates of local and wifi distributions, with related codes if there is a general code for the distribution.
* **Capture probability calculation**: you can now calculate it directly on your 3DS, for every generation starting by the third. You can also calculate how much tries are needed to reach a certain probability of success.

**Is this a hacking application?** 

#NOPE.
It just allows you to stay updated on things and check validity of other things, it doesn't allow to do nothing on your game cartridge, nor to steal events or codes.

You can see [**there**](http://imgur.com/a/YGaH3) some pictures of the application running.

**What will come next?**

* Much more informations related to PID checking;
* a NTR plugin that allows you to calculate capture probability in **real time**, while playing.

Tell me if you like this work and what you would have featured in the next update! :)
