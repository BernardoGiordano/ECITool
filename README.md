Multipurpose and portable save manager for generations IV-VII, programmed in C.

* Supports original cartridges and digital copies of games from DPPT to USUM
* Allows on-the-fly modifications to all of your data
* Allows internal and resizable offline storage to store your pkmns
* Interfaces with multiple ad-hoc programs running on your computer, web browser or smartphone
* Capable of scanning QR codes to inject both pkmn files or event wondercards
* Contains an offline wondercard database to get events from old distributions

**I do not support or condone cheating at the expense of others. Do not use significantly edited pkmn in battle or in trades with those who are unaware edited pkmn are in use.**

## Installation

This software works on cfw and *hax/rosalina-based Homebrew Launchers. An internet connection may be required at the first launch.

| Entrypoint | Instructions |
| :--------: | :----------- |
| cfw | Install the `PKSM.cia` file provided in the release page with your favourite installer. You can now launch the application from the home menu |
| rosalina hbl | Move `PKSM.3dsx` from the rosalina folder in the `PKSM.zip` file. You can now launch PKSM from a [rosalina-based homebrew launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu) |
| *hax hbl | Move `PKSM.3dsx` and `PKSM.xml` from the standard folder in the `PKSM.zip` file. You can now launch PKSM from a [*hax-based homebrew launcher](https://smealum.github.io/ninjhax2/starter.zip) |

If you get a **failed to receive a status code** error, you may want to connect your console to the internet. This is needed to download the additional assets required for the application to launch. 

You need internet access to download the additional assets. If you can't still download them through the application, put them manually in the SD card, extracting the external [additionalassets](https://github.com/dsoldier/PKResources/releases/download/final/additionalassets.zip) folder in your SD card, located at `/3ds/PKSM/`. The final result should be a folder filled with assets, located at `/3ds/PKSM/additionalassets/`.

### DS cartridges

To let PKSM load your DS save correctly:

* If using rosalina, you need to inject the homebrew launcher in a title that has DS saves access.
* If using *hax, you need to select a target title that has DS save access when selecting PKSM from the homebrew launcher.

A title satisfying those specifics is, for example, Pok√©transporter.

### Storage changes from 5.0.0+

If you're coming from a PKSM version < 5.0.0, you'll notice your `bank.bin` file isn't recognized anymore. That's because the working path changed from 5.0.0 so you need to **manually move** your `bank.bin` file to the new location, from `/3ds/data/PKSM/bank/` to `/3ds/PKSM/bank`. 

## Applications supported by PKSM

* **[serveLegality](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM-Tools)**: PC tool to check and fix a pkmn's legality.

* **[MysteryGiftBot](https://twitter.com/mysterygiftbot)**: Generates .wc7 QR codes scannable from PKSM. Runs on Twitter.
* **[servepkx](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM-Tools)**: multiplatform tool to send .pk7, .pk6, .wc7full, .wc6full, .wc7, .wc6 files to PKSM. Requires a web browser or JRE.
* **[phbank2pksm](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM-Tools)**: tool to convert a PHBank bank file to a PKSM storage file. Requires a web browser.
* **[badsectors](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM-Tools)**: tool to fix bad slots in the PKSM storage file. Runs on the homebrew launcher.

## Troubleshooting

Before submitting an issue, look for it into the issues page, because it could have been already answered in the past.

Please only do consistent issues (submitting your environment and which version of PKSM you're running), without asking for the moon: I'm working for free here. Duplicate issues will be closed without any reply.

I'll not reply to issues related to versions of PKSM different from the latest stable release currently available.

## Building

PKSM requires [latest libctru](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib), [latest citro3d](https://github.com/fincs/citro3d) and [latest pp2d](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/PKSM/tree/master/source/pp2d). The executable can be compiled with [devkitARM r47+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/).To compile the .cia you need [3dstool](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases), [bannertool and makerom](https://github.com/Steveice10/buildtools/tree/master/3ds) in your PATH. Run the command `make all` to build both the .3dsx and .cia.
